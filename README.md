# Denomination
A Currency Converter Android Application

* Denomination is a currency converter Android Application. It uses background services and receivers to download the data and perform some action (the conversion rate calculation) on a schedule.
* The schedule is decided by us (every minute, every day etc). 
* Also the conversion rate, overtime,  between the two currencies can be visualized through a graph.
* The app posts system wide notifications too when not in the foreground.
